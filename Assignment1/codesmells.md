# List of code smells

## Code Smell 1: Long Method

### Code Smell Category: Bloaters

### List of classes and line numbers involved:

* Class HungryFish, lines 132-161.

### Description:

The contains too many lines that can be split up and integrate into other methods in the class.

### Solution:

    For lines 141 - 144 in method move(), the code can be integrate into the blowBubble() method (line 48) within the same
class. And then just call the blowBubble() method.
    Lines 146 - 149 in method move() can be integrate into the turnAround() method (line87), and just call the method
turnAround() instead of the original code.
    for lines 154 - 160 in method move() can be written as a separate method to determine whether the hungry fish will
move up or down, and can just call that method in move().



### Explanation

    My solution get rid of the code smell by breaking the original move() method into several parts that can be extracted
and merge to existing methods within the class.
